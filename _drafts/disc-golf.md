# The Game of Disc Golf

 I recently got into playing Disc Golf, which you may or may not be familiar with. Below is the definition according to Wikipedia:
> "Disc Golf (often referred to as frisbee golf, frolf, or folf) is a flying disc game, as well as a precision and accuracy sport, in which individual players throw a flying disc at a target."

I must say at first when I was asked to play I thought it would be a rather easy game, but oh I was I ever wrong! It turned out to be a rather challenging and rewarding. Disc Golf is a great activity for a group wether it be family, friends, or fellow players.

Currently I have only been playing for a little over one month, I have a total of 9 discs which are listed below. More discs are sure to come.

  {: .o-list }
  1. Star Mamba - Distance Driver (Innova)
  2. Skeeter - Mid Range (Innova)
  3. Nuke SS - Distance Driver (Discraft)
  4. TL3 - Fairway Driver (Innova)
  5. Dominator - Distance Driver (Innova)
  6. Pro Wraith - Distance Driver (Innova)
  7. Pro Wraith - Distance Driver (Innova)
  7. VIP Plastic King - Distance Driver (Westside Discs)
  8. R-Pro Aviar - Putter (Innova)

So far disc golf has been something I look froward to playing each week with my friends, after all it is a gerat sport to play with others.
