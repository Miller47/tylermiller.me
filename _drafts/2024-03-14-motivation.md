# Motivation, what, why, and how?

As a developer in training, the key question is how to stay motivated. I aim to use this as a way to motivate myself and hopefully inspire others. Personally, I find staying motivated very challenging, not just in software development but in all aspects of life. This difficulty may be linked to my untreated childhood ADHD. At 30 years old, I struggle to focus on tasks I enjoy or have an interest in, whether it's gaming, coding, movies, or TV shows. It's hard to stick to one task and start what I intend to work on. This challenge grows more pronounced as I age. As I type this, my motivation is fading by the second, and I will likely stop and forget I ever started. The current date is March 14, 2024. Let's see where I end this. At one point, coding was rather happy and rewarding for me, but I soon left that feeling behind and took a break of nearly 8 years on and off at first, then a solid 6 years straight. As such, I have been trying to get back into this world for around 4 months now. During this time, I have relearned many things but also gone on side quests after side quests instead of the main objective (probably only around 1 month here). Don't get me wrong, each side quest does bring more and more knowledge, but this is knowledge that may not be needed at all when I could be focusing on the things that will. If I had the magic answer to this, I would share it, but as of this time, the only thing that could help is likely ADHD meds.

Moving on, even the loved activity of gaming has lost meaning as I have aged. It used to mean an escape from the realities of the world and a way to relax. These days, it's more of a chore to play anything without friends; however, even then, I tend to leave the headset on and move to the computer and scroll for the entire time, then shortly after just get off the game and do nothing at all. I wish there was a way to truly figure my stuff out and tell anyone else struggling how to as well. This is not that post.
