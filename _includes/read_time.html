<!-- 
  This code calculates the estimated read time for a post or content.
  It uses the Liquid templating language to check the number of words in the post or content.
  If the number of words is less than 360, it displays an estimated read time of 1 minute.
  Otherwise, it calculates the estimated read time based on the number of words divided by 180.
