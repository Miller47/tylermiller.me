Hello, My name is Tyler Miller, and I live in Michigan, USA. I write iOS apps using Swift. I currently have one app or rather game in the App Store called Dodging Asteroids, which you can read more about [here](https://millerapps.github.io/dodging-asteroids).   

On this site I will be talking about topics which I find interesting or want to learn more about. Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you at some point. 

Feel free to contact me through [twitter](https://twitter.com/MillerApps) or [thetylermiller4@gmail.com](mailto: {{ site.email }} ?subject=What's%20Up?).
