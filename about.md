Hello, My name is Tyler Miller. I am an iOS developer, I like to work with new and exciting technologies. I am the owner(founder)/lead developer at Miller Apps.

I currently have one app or rather game in the App Store called Dodging Asteroids, which you can read more about [here](http://www.tylermiller.me/dodging-asteroids/). I am actively working on new ideas that usually end up being a simple learning experience. 

On this site I will be talking about topics which I find interesting or want to learn more about. Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you at some point.
