<!--
This HTML code represents a section of a webpage that displays a card deck of projects or works. Each card represents a different project and includes an image, title, and a link to the project's website or repository.

The layout, title, permalink, and navigation weight are specified using Jekyll front matter, which is enclosed in three dashes at the beginning and end of the code block.

The card deck is created using the Bootstrap framework, with each card having a unique image, title, and link. The images are displayed at the top of each card, followed by the project title. The project title is wrapped in an anchor tag that links to the project's website or repository. The target attribute is set to "_blank" to open the link in a new tab, and the rel attribute is set to "external nofollow" to indicate that the link is external and should not be followed by search engines.

The first card represents a project called "Dodging Asteroids" and includes an image of asteroids. The second card represents a project called "MARoundButton" and includes an image of the GitHub logo. The third card represents a project called "Forge Fitness Website" and includes an image of the Forge Fitness logo.

Each card is enclosed in a div element with the class "card". The card's content is wrapped in a div element with the class "card-block". The project title is displayed as an h4 element with the class "card-title".

Note: The actual file path may vary depending on the location of the file on the user's system.
