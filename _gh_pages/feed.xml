        <title>Jekyll My Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To begin I am new to Jekyll and I have not done any web development since 2013 ish. To elaborate a little more, I primarily focus on iOS development and really only dabbled in web (not my favorite thing). I recently found out about Jekyll and decided to give it a shot, after all I kind of needed a website. So I began with the setup and created my first Jekyll project, I found the whole setup process to be very simple in fact even enjoyable. Next came the customization of my new site, armed with my limited knowledge of CSS I began the process of making the site my own. Along the way I found myself wondering about a few things and luckily the answers were always in reach thanks to many blogs talking about Jekyll. After a few days of twaeking, I finally had something I enjoyed and for no cost other than time and domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say Jekyll made the task of creating a website that much easier while maintaining full customizability. Overall I think Jekyll is a great tool for any developer or blogger that wants more control but also doesn’t want the headache of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll has got me interested in web again and I hope to dive deeper into both.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dodging Asteroids (my first app/game)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dodging Asteroids is the very first iOS app that I have released. I worked on it for around two months while learning SpriteKit (Apple’s 2d Gaming framework), it was a very good experience overall. As with anything there of course were some points of difficulty. Over this period I found SpriteKit to be very easy to work with with a few exceptions due to un-fixed bugs, overall I would say SpriteKit is a great gaming framework for anyone looking to create a 2d game for any iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for a little about the app, it is a game set in space with a simple goal to dodge the asteroids for as long as possible. Along the way spacemen will spawn on occasion that will provide the player you to gain an extra life (up to 3) and 5 extra points. If you would like to check Dodging Asteroids it is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dodging-asteriods/id969815744?mt=8&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;
