        <title>MARoundButton</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;maroundbutton&quot;&gt;MARoundButton&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARoundButton is a simple UIButton subclass written in Swift 2.2 that allows for easy rounding of UIButtons. MARoundButton supports Interface Builder as well as directly through code. MARoundButton is my first open sourced project, albeit a simple one. If you are interested in using MARoundButton it can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MillerApps/MARoundButton&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MARoundButton is available through &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocoapods.org&quot;&gt;CocoaPods&lt;/a&gt;. To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pod&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;MARoundButton&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-to-use&quot;&gt;How To Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MARoundButton can be used through StoryBoards by adding a UIButton to the View and under the identity inspector select MARoundButton as the class and the module. All the properties can be changed within the attributes inspector tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MARoundButton can also be used through code just like a normal UIButton. Just remember to set the Round button properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://g.recordit.co/wiUK3mqQ1Z.gif&quot; alt=&quot;StoryBoard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;todo&quot;&gt;TODO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a demo project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add code demo for Swift and Objective-C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Shotty Bird</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1114259560?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Shotty Bird&lt;/a&gt; is a free iOS game developed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jorgetapia.net/&quot;&gt;Jorge Tapia&lt;/a&gt; which was released earlier today. Shotty Bird provides the user with a simple and familiar feeling game that keeps us entertained in times of boredom while still providing a challenge. During my time playing Shotty Bird I achieved a score of 31, which took a fair amount of time.&lt;span class=&quot;image-holder&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/MillerApps_2016-Jun-03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;score&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; Once I learned the mechanics the game became a little easier while remaining challenging. Throughout the entire game you will be delighted to a great little melody and wonderful visuals. I urge everyone to give Shotty Bird a try.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jekyll My Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To begin I am new to Jekyll and I have not done any web development since 2013 ish. To elaborate a little more, I primarily focus on iOS development and really only dabbled in web (not my favorite thing). I recently found out about Jekyll and decided to give it a shot, after all I kind of needed a website. So I began with the setup and created my first Jekyll project, I found the whole setup process to be very simple in fact even enjoyable. Next came the customization of my new site, armed with my limited knowledge of CSS I began the process of making the site my own. Along the way I found myself wondering about a few things and luckily the answers were always in reach thanks to many blogs talking about Jekyll. After a few days of twaeking, I finally had something I enjoyed and for no cost other than time and domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say Jekyll made the task of creating a website that much easier while maintaining full customizability. Overall I think Jekyll is a great tool for any developer or blogger that wants more control but also doesn’t want the headache of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll has got me interested in web again and I hope to dive deeper into both.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dodging Asteroids (my first app/game)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dodging Asteroids is the very first iOS app that I have released. I worked on it for around two months while learning SpriteKit (Apple’s 2d Gaming framework), it was a very good experience overall. As with anything there of course were some points of difficulty. Over this period I found SpriteKit to be very easy to work with with a few exceptions due to un-fixed bugs, overall I would say SpriteKit is a great gaming framework for anyone looking to create a 2d game for any iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for a little about the app, it is a game set in space with a simple goal to dodge the asteroids for as long as possible. Along the way spacemen will spawn on occasion that will provide the player you to gain an extra life (up to 3) and 5 extra points. If you would like to check Dodging Asteroids it is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dodging-asteriods/id969815744?mt=8&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;
