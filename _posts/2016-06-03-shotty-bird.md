[Shotty Bird](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1114259560?ls=1&mt=8) is a free iOS game developed by [Jorge Tapia](http://jorgetapia.net/) which was released earlier today. Shotty Bird provides the user with a simple and familiar feeling game that keeps us entertained in times of boredom while still providing a challenge. During my time playing Shotty Bird I achieved a score of 31, which took a fair amount of time.{% include img.html url="/assets/MillerApps-2016-Jun-03.jpg" description="score" %} Once I learned the mechanics the game became a little easier while remaining challenging. Throughout the entire game you will be delighted to a great little melody and wonderful visuals. I urge everyone to give Shotty Bird a try.
