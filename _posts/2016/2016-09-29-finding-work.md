Let us talk about finding work today as a new iOS Developer with little experience. It seems to be a very large challenge to get into the industry without having vast amounts of knowledge and experience, in my experience, it only leads to frustration and let down.

After a year of trying to find a place in the mobile industry and failing, the only option left is to just keep trying. It's just a little discouraging to always hear you need more experience. I’m just at a loss as to how to gain the professional experience needed to get my start.

This post hasn’t really provided any useful information on how to overcome this obstacle, rather it was more of a way to express my feelings and share my experience. I hope you enjoyed it anyways!
