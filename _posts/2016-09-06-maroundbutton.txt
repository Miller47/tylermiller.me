### MARoundButton 
MARoundButton is a simple UIButton subclass written in Swift 2.2 that allows for easy rounding of UIButtons. MARoundButton supports Interface Builder as well as directly through code. MARoundButton is my first open sourced project, albeit a simple one. If you are interested in using MARoundButton it can be found on [Github](https://github.com/MillerApps/MARoundButton). 

#### Installation

MARoundButton is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'MARoundButton'
```

#### How To Use

MARoundButton can be used through StoryBoards by adding a UIButton to the View and under the identity inspector select MARoundButton as the class and the module. All the properties can be changed within the attributes inspector tab. 

MARoundButton can also be used through code just like a normal UIButton. Just remember to set the Round button properties.
