Dodging Asteroids is the very first iOS app that I have released. I worked on it for around two months while learning SpriteKit (Apple's 2d Gaming framework), it was a very good experience overall. As with anything there of course were some points of difficulty. Over this period I found SpriteKit to be very easy to work with with a few exceptions due to un-fixed bugs, overall I would say SpriteKit is a great gaming framework for anyone looking to create a 2d game for any iOS device. 

Now for a little about the app, it is a game set in space with a simple goal to dodge the asteroids for as long as possible. Along the way spacemen will spawn on occasion that will provide the player you to gain an extra life (up to 3) and 5 extra points. If you would like to check Dodging Asteroids it is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dodging-asteriods/id969815744?mt=8){:target="_blank"} today!
